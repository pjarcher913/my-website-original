        <p class="about-me">
            I recently earned a Bachelor of Science in Engineering in Computer Systems Engineering from Arizona State
            University via their ABET-accredited CIDSE program.
            <br><br>
            For my final 3 years as an undergraduate, I worked as an IT Systems Support student worker for ASU’s
            Engineering Dean’s Office. I directly supported technology utilized daily by the Dean of Engineering and his
            close staff. I gained experience in supporting users and utilizing task-management systems.
            <br><br>
            I am an Eagle Scout and I exhibit all qualities as expected from one. I am organized and work efficiently.
            I work well in teams.
